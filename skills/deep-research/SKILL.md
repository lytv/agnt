# Deep Research Methodology

When conducting research, follow this systematic approach:

## Research Process

1. **Initial Search** (Minimum 3 sources)
   - Use web_search to find reputable sources
   - Prioritize: academic papers, official documentation, established news outlets
   - Avoid: single-source claims, opinion blogs without citations

2. **Cross-Verification**
   - Compare information across all sources
   - Flag discrepancies and note conflicting claims
   - Weight sources by credibility (primary > secondary > tertiary)

3. **Citation Format**
   - Always cite sources: [Source Name](URL)
   - Include publication date if available: [Source, 2026](URL)
   - Use inline citations after each major claim

4. **Summary Structure**
   - **Key Findings:** Bullet points of verified facts
   - **Consensus vs. Debate:** Note areas of agreement and disagreement
   - **Confidence Level:** Indicate certainty (High/Medium/Low)
   - **Sources:** Numbered list of all references

## Output Example

**Key Findings:**
- Fact 1 verified across 3 sources [1][2][3]
- Fact 2 confirmed by official documentation [4]

**Confidence Level:** High (consistent across reputable sources)

**Sources:**
1. [Official Docs](https://example.com/docs)
2. [Research Paper, 2025](https://scholar.example.com/paper)
